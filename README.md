### I'm just practicing python by making cli toys.
 
# cliMon
A really basic CLI pokemon clone. it's maybe too random to be practical, but it is mostly a game.
run "python cliMon.py" to play the game. Enter names for your PyCliMon (First 3 for player one, last 3 for player two), then use 1, 2, and enter keys to play.
my error handling is currently bad, so don't get cute with your inputs.


# typer
To play, you need to create a csv with two columns, "Words" and "Best Time". the words column should be populated by you.
Validation takes place for the entire column, so you can use whole sentences or single words
##### I've spent the entire day reading through the southern reach trilogy instead of coding. whoops.

### I'm just practicing python by making a shitty text adventure.
 
# cliMon
A really basic CLI pokemon clone. it's maybe too random to be practical, but it is mostly a game.
run "python cliMon.py" to play the game. Enter names for your PyCliMon (First 3 for player one, last 3 for player two), then use 1, 2, and enter keys to play.
my error handling is currently bad, so don't get cute with your inputs.
